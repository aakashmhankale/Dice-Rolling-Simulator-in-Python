# Dice-Rolling-Simulator-in-Python
The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. The program will print what that number is. Then it ask you if youâ€™d like to roll again.
